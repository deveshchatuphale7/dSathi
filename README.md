## Decentralized transaction dispute platform powered by Algorand network

## Overview

Fintech is complicated as millions of transactions involving more than one participant are executed per second.
As Fintech is evolving at high pace, banks, digital wallets, UPI is growing rapidly, the customer support, dispute resolution
process is still conventional, opaque & tedious

## Proposed solution

Hence considering the gravity of this problem, I would like to propose a blockchain based portal for transaction dispute
resolution and grievance redressal powered by Algorand Smart contracts.

In many cases of transaction disputes, various entities are involved e.g. banks, fintech institutions & digital wallets.
This creates ambiguity at the customer's end as the customer has to be in touch with all entities to get his/her issue resolved & there is 
no single source of truth.

So in such scenarios Blockchain can be leveraged to overcome these situations, where all the entities can refer & use a single platform
to understand & speculate on cause of the dispute, update the status of the problem securely so that other entities involved can also
get the updated information. At the same time the customer also has visibility of the progress.

As the all progress is stored on blockchain, data is immutable, secure & can not be modified by untrusted entities.


## Tech stack

 - Angular 10 for the UI
 - Algorand SDK for Javascript in Node.JS for Algorand network  
 - AWS EC2/ digitalocean for deployment
